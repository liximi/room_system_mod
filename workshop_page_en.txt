[h2]How to Add a Dependency[/h2]
In [b][i]modinfo.lua[/i][/b], set the load priority to [b]a negative number[/b]. (This mod’s priority is 0, so a negative priority ensures your mod loads after this mod).
[quote]
priority = negative number
[/quote]
In [b][i]modinfo.lua[/i][/b], use the official dependency configuration format:
[quote]
local chinese = locale == "zh" or locale  == "zhr"
mod_dependencies = {

		[chinese and "Rooms" or "房间"] = true,
	},
}
[/quote]
[h2]How to Add New Room Types[/h2]
Once dependent, you can call the global function provided by this mod in your mod’s modmain (this must be called on both the host and the client).
[quote]
